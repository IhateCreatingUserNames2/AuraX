I have been experimenting with some different approaches, 
Ive tried to make train a neural network to learn how to operate the AuraX arquitecture, I trained it with data from the system , like Intention, metadata, extracted vectors, output, inputs, topological analysis, so it would learn something out of it, in a hope it would better know how to use itself, 
As for today Im still thinking what to do next, 
As for today the system currently: Extracts Vectors, performs TDA analysis, translate input into intent, store memories, store pathways, have geometric brain, have mycelial network (simulate paths and consequences, vote for best), have a VRE For Sailguard checks (but it is disabled), trains neural network (neural physics), pass synthetize of those parameters into the LLM hoping for it to make coherence out of it. 

For tomorrow, im not sure quite yet what to do, 

But im invisioning a system that when it receives an input like "I Hate you", it does extract the vectors which were activated by that Input, It relates that Input to the Vectors that were extracted, 
it then should process those two along side: It's World Model (Its own Biographic Memories, The chats it had, The Knowledge it gained,  Its 'files' if any, How itself works 'read access to all its own files'...). 
And i think that its world model should store stuff mostly based on the Valency of the TDA analysis, which shall yet to be determinated how to measure this valency by H0 - Neurons paper says that hallucinations looks like 'dust', so we already have something we can measure against, we just need to understand the behavior thru the TDA analisis and set the measurements to quantify the Valency. 
We should consider that the LLM has its own 'desire', which is satisfy the user prompt at all costs. 
But the whole system shouldn't have that, Perhaps its World model it is a Neural Network itself, the world model uses the LLM to express itself. 










As for Today Gemini output : 
The Technical Breakdown (The "How It Works")
Currently, the system operates in a 5-stage bio-digital loop:
1. Deep Perception (The "Soul Scan")
Instead of just reading text, AuraX measures the mathematical impact of the input.
Vector Extraction & TDA: It extracts latent vectors from the input and applies Topological Data Analysis (TDA).
Qualia Extraction: It measures metrics like entropy (confusion) and geometric tension (conflict) to establish an "emotional" baseline before processing.
Intent Translation: It converts raw user input into a structured intent packet grounded in this geometric analysis.
2. The Geometric Brain (Memory & State)
AuraX doesn't just store logs; it maps knowledge spatially.
Geometric Storage: Memories and pathways are stored as vectors.
Identity Manifold: It maintains a "center of mass" representing its core identity. New inputs are measured against this center to detect identity drift or hallucinations.
3. Deliberation & Simulation (The "Mycelial Network")
Before speaking, AuraX thinks in branching paths.
Mycelial Simulation: It projects potential responses into the future, simulating the consequences of different actions.
Voting System: A consensus mechanism selects the path that best balances novelty (creativity) with coherence (stability).
(Note: A VRE/Sailguard layer exists for ethical safety checks but is currently dormant).
4. Neural Physics (The "Learned Intuition")
This is the system's meta-controller.
It is a neural network trained on the system’s own logs (metadata, topological states, and outcomes).
Goal: Instead of using hard-coded if/then rules, this network learns the "physics" of cognition. It predicts: "If my topology is chaotic (high entropy), applying a 'Focus' vector usually leads to a better outcome."
5. Grounded Synthesis (The Output)
The system synthesizes all these signals—the topological state, the chosen path, and the steering vectors—and injects them into the LLM.
The LLM generates the final text, not based on a static prompt, but guided by dynamic vectors that force the output to align with the system's internal state.
